## Description
This API is for a social network application where a user can share their personal or professional thoughts, react to a friends' thought or thoughts, as well as creat a friends list. The web application uses `MongoDB` for databases, `Mongoose` for ODM, `Express.js` for routing, and `Moment.js` for date & timestamps. The data is seeded using `Insomnia`.

## Features
1. This is an API based social network that utilizes the noSQL database, MongoDB, by allowing a user to structure the large quantity of unstructured data.

2. Once a user enters the command to run the application, Mongoose models will then be synced to MondoDB database.

3. When a user opens the API GET routes for thoughts and users using Insomnia, they will be displayed as JSON format.

4. The routes of Reactions, Thoughts, Users, & Friends were created to test the functionality of the API utilizing Insomnia.

5. User Routes - A user can input a username and email to be assigned a unique ID.

To CREATE a new user, select `POST` request and enter the new user's username and email address following the models-User.js format. Click `Send`.



## Installation
- Clone this repository in a code editor similar to VS Code on your local machine.
- `npm i` must be used in a users integrated terminal to download the required dependencies.

## Usage
- A user can spin up the server by typing `node server.js` in the terminal.
- Once server is started a user can use Compass to easily determine if the Mongoose models were synched to the MongoDB database.
- In Compass, select the database named socialNetworkAPIDB. 
- At this point the user should see the two models created `thoughts` and `users`. 
- Select either of the two models to verify data is seeded by user utilizing Insomnia.
