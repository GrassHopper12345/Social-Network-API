4. The routes of Reactions, Thoughts, Users, & Friends were created to test the functionality of the API utilizing Insomnia.

5. User Routes - A user can input a username and email to be assigned a unique ID.


## Installation
- Clone this repository in a code editor similar to VS Code on your local machine.
- `npm i` must be used in a users integrated terminal to download the required dependencies.

## Usage
- A user can spin up the server by typing `node server.js` in the terminal.
- Once server is started a user can use Compass to easily determine if the Mongoose models were synched to the MongoDB database.
- In Compass, select the database named socialNetworkAPIDB. 
- At this point the user should see the two models created `thoughts` and `users`. 
- Select either of the two models to verify data is seeded by user utilizing Insomnia.
